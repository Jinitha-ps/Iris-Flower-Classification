# Iris-Flower-Classification

**About the Project: Iris Flower Classification**
This project is a fundamental machine learning classification task designed to build a predictive model capable of classifying Iris flowers into their correct species. This project was completed as part of the CodSoft Data Science Internship.

üå∏ **Objective**
The primary goal is to train a supervised machine learning model that can learn from the physical measurements of Iris flowers and accurately predict the species of a new, unseen flower. This automates the taxonomic identification process based on measurable traits.

üìä **Dataset**
The project utilizes the famous Iris Dataset, a classic benchmark in machine learning and statistics.

Total Samples: 150 instances.

Target Classes (Species): There are 50 samples for each of the three Iris species:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

Features: Each sample is described by four numerical features, all measured in centimeters:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology and Algorithms**
The workflow involves several key data science steps, culminating in the training and evaluation of a classification model:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between features (e.g., using pair plots) to identify patterns, feature importance, and separability between the species.

Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data by handling any missing values and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

Model Training: Implementing and training a classification algorithm on the training data. Common models used for this task include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the final model's predictive capability on the unseen test data using metrics such as Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
